Opening software programs with voice commands!

I have used the concept of dictionaries and looping constructs instead of a lot of nested if statements.

Note:
To run the program, you should have pyaudio and SpeechRecognition libraries installed.
Internet connection is required as Google Speech Recognition is used.

Future improvements:
1.Using NLP instead of manually coding in the software names.
2.Optimization of existing code
